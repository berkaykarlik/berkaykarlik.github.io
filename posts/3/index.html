I will be solving at least a question a day to stay consistent and avoid burnout. I&#39;m following the roadmap from a practice site called <a href="https://neetcode.io/roadmap">neetcode</a> because I think following some kind of structured list is better than choosing questions at random. I have started like 10 days ago and solved 15 questions already, but I can&#39;t come with good answers on my own, my answers are mostly brute force. After attempting my own I always look up for the video explanation and efficient solutions to learn something from the attempt. So far I have been consistent by solving daily, but it becomes quite annoying when you can&#39;t solve it on your own. This was just a brief update to keep myself accountable. Hope I can continue and get better.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Berkay KarlÄ±k. Last modified: July 11, 2023.
