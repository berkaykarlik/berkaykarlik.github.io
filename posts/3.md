# Grinding LeetCode

Recently, I have decided to grind some LeetCode so that I can get better at my programming skills and be prepared for future job interviews. I will be solving at least a question a day to stay consistent and avoid burnout.
I'm following the roadmap from a practice site called [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) because I think following some kind of structured list is better than choosing questions at random.
I have started like 10 days ago and solved 15 questions already, but I can't come with good answers on my own, my answers are mostly brute force. After attempting my own I always look up for the video explanation and efficient solutions
to learn something from the attempt. So far I have been consistent by solving daily, but it becomes quite annoying when you can't solve it on your own. This was just a brief update to keep myself accountable. Hope I can continue and get better.
