Hello there!

My name is Berkay. I'am a software developer. Though it's a fun profession, being a good developer is not my only aspiration.
I would like to learn and experience any novelty I find interesting. As such my plan is to use this blog as a journal and self-documentation of my journey.
In the process, it would be great to get some reader but if not that's fine too. It can be just a self-journal thing.\
So get ready to jump from topic to topic. We will program (haha no escape from that), learn, read, play, move, see, hear, travel, experience and more...

P.S This is my second blogging attempt to be honest. Previously, I didn't post at all let alone being a regular poster. This time I will stick with it.

See you around!
